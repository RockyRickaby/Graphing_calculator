# Simple graphing 

This was made as a learning experience. It isn't all that useful (nor optimized).

## Building and running

Run these commands on your terminal of choice:

```console
$ mvn package
$ java -jar ./target/graphingcalculator-<current version>.jar
```

You will find the current version in the POM file.
